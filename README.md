### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootsrap for using ready made classes
- Functional JavaScript Code - functions are structured in a more modular way, making it easier to understand and maintain. 

### What I learned

I have learned to organize my code as well as I can. After the app was working as it should, I reviewed my code, cleaned it up, and organized it into functions to avoid repeating myself. I also made the functions easy to read and understand.
